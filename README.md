# log_neural_net
1. An Artificial Neural Network **(ANN)** for **synthetically** generating **sonic logs** from **conventional petro-physical logs**, using a optimized neural network pipeline written in **TensorFlow** (Keras) - **Python**. The pipe-line is hyper-prametrically tuned.
2. For interacting with this Neural Network, a web-based **Front-end**, implemented in **ReactJS** has been provided.
